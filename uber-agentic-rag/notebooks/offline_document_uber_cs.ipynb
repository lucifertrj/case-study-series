Video documentaries on inspirational luminaries of India, ancient and modern, in\\nscience and beyond, will be shown at appropriate points throughout the school curriculum. Students\\nwill be encouraged to visit different States as part of cultural exchange programmes.\\n4.28. Students will be taught at a young age the importance of “doing what's right”, and will be given\\na logical framework for making ethical decisions. In later years, this would then be expanded along\\nthemes of cheating, violence, plagiarism, littering, tolerance, equality, empathy, etc., with a view to\\nenabling children to embrace moral/ethical values in conducting one's life, formulate a\\nposition/argument about an ethical issue from multiple perspectives, and use ethical practices in all\\nwork. As consequences of such basic ethical reasoning, traditional Indian values and all basic human\\nand Constitutional values (such as seva, ahimsa, swachchhata, satya, nishkam karma, shanti,\\nsacrifice, tolerance, diversity, pluralism, righteous conduct, gender sensitivity, respect for elders,\\nrespect for all people and their inherent capabilities regardless of background, respect for\\nenvironment, helpfulness, courtesy, patience, forgiveness, empathy, compassion, patriotism,\\ndemocratic outlook, integrity, responsibility, justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity) will be\\ndeveloped in all students. Children will have the opportunity to read and learn from the original\\nstories of the Panchatantra, Jataka, Hitopadesh, and other fun fables and inspiring tales from the\\nIndian tradition and learn about their influences on global literature. Excerpts from the Indian\\nConstitution will also be considered essential reading for all students. Basic training in health,\\nincluding preventive health, mental health, good nutrition, personal and public hygiene, disaster\\nresponse and first-aid will also be included in the curriculum, as well as scientific explanations of the\\ndetrimental and damaging effects of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs.\\n4.29. All curriculum and pedagogy, from the foundational stage onwards, will be redesigned to be\\nstrongly rooted in the Indian and local context and ethos in terms of culture, traditions, heritage,\\ncustoms, language, philosophy, geography, ancient and contemporary knowledge, societal and\\nscientific needs, indigenous and traditional ways of learning etc. – in order to ensure that education is\\nmaximally relatable, relevant, interesting, and effective for our students. Stories, arts, games, sports,\\nexamples, problems, etc. will be chosen as much as possible to be rooted in the Indian and local\\ngeographic context. Ideas, abstractions, and creativity will indeed best flourish when learning is thus\\nrooted.\\n\", 'source': 'data/NEP_Final_English_0.pdf', 'page': 16, 'document_summary': \"The National Education Policy 2020 aims to provide universal access to quality education in India, aligning with the country's vision for economic growth, social justice, and national development.
